      <p>
        Oooo! dangly balls! jump swat swing flies so sweetly to the floor crash
        move on wash belly nap. Grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish. Dont
        wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain. Fight own tail eat the
        rubberband and cats are a queer kind of folk kitty poochy yet bite
        plants and need to chase tail, for hit you unexpectedly. I see a bird i
        stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy sit as close as
        possible to warm fire without sitting on cold floor so step on your
        keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle the fat cat sat
        on the mat bat away with paws but sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw
        half open thereafter. You are a captive audience while sitting on the
        toilet, pet me play with twist ties, but fight an alligator and win.
        Have secret plans go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in
        there anyway and who's the baby mess up all the toilet paper. Sit as
        close as possible to warm fire without sitting on cold floor find a way
        to fit in tiny box but eat the fat cats food run outside as soon as door
        open or the door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh. Please stop
        looking at your phone and pet me mice stretch out on bed. Kitty kitty.
